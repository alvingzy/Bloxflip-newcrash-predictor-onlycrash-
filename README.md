I tried ig my first time coding something this complex (if there are issues pls tell me)
 
 Set up!
 So what you are gonna wanna do is open the config file and all you really need to do is just optimise it to your type
 Like how many average (a bit more accurate) 5 rows or 10 rows!
 Once you are done just open the main.py and you are done! :)
